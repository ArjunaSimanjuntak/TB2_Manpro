                        ○ Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning that they are transferred to animals and humans. There
                        were originally six types of coronaviruses known to be transmittable to humans. <br>

                        ○ Among these six types, four types cause illnesses like the flu, and the other two are called
                        MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. <br>

                        ○ Sequencing has confirmed that the causative virus of this outbreak – the novel coronavirus
                        (SARS-CoV-2) – is an 89.1% match with SARS-like virus originating from bats.

                        ○ COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs
                        or sneezes. The virus is transmitted by these droplets that are inhaled by other people or from
                        people touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with hands with the virus on them. <br>

                        ○ In addition, since touching surfaces with droplets produced by infected people on them and
                        then touching the eyes, nose, and mouth can transmit the virus, it is imperative that you wash
                        your hands thoroughly.

                        ○ The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                        aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                        usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and
                        don't feel unwell. <br>

                        ○ Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment, but older
                        people, and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems
                        or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness, which is why people with fever, cough
                        and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. <br>

                        ○ The main way the disease spreads is through inhaling respiratory droplets expelled by someone
                        who is coughing or contact. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all
                        is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms, which is why it
                        is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has little to no symptoms. <br>

                        ○ WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will share

                        designated locations (COVID-19 screening centers, etc.). Upper respiratory tract sampling is
                        mandatory, while lower respiratory tract sampling is optional for patients with sputum. You may
                        experience discomfort/pain while the sample is being collected. <br>

                        reference laboratories.
